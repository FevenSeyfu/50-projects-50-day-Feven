# 50 Projects in 50 Days - Day 1: Expanding Cards

Welcome to my repository documenting my first day's project from the "50 Projects in 50 Days" challenge by Feven Seyfu.

## Project Overview

This project, "Expanding Cards," involved creating a simple interactive layout with expanding cards that enlarge upon selection. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the cards expand smoothly and can display additional content, providing an engaging user experience.

### Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I encountered challenges in fine-tuning the transition effects and ensuring a smooth expansion and contraction of the cards without distortion.


### Learning Experience

This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling. I learned how to manage dynamic content display on a webpage while maintaining a sleek and responsive design.

### Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to refine the animations further, possibly adding more card options and incorporating responsive design principles for various screen sizes.
